# WAGTAIL ICONIFY

##### Library developed for **Wagtail CMS**, its purpose is to provide icon blocks from various libraries

#### **Special thanks to [Alex Gleason](https://github.com/alexgleason), as well as for his [wagtail-fontawesome](https://github.com/alexgleason/wagtailfontawesome) library (V4.7), which helped me many times, as well as to support me in part of his code for the configuration of some things**
